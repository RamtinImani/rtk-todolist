# 📝 rtk-todolist

rtk-todolist is a simple and interactive **Todo List Application** built with React and Redux Toolkit. This project demonstrates the core functionality of a todo app where you can **add**, **delete**, and **mark todos as completed**.  
It was created as part of my journey to practice and improve my state management skills with Redux Toolkit. 🚀
